# Gravitational Wormhole
Wormhole is a simple [CNI plugin](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) designed to create an encrypted overlay network for [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) clusters.

[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) is a fascinating Fast, Modern, Secure VPN tunnel, that has been gaining significant praise from security experts, and is currently proposed for inclusion within the linux kernel.

Wormhole uses wireguard to create a simple and secure high performance encrypted overlay network for kubernetes clusters, that is easy to manage and troubleshoot.

Wormhole does not implement network policy, instead we recommend to use [calico](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico) or [kube-router](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router) as network policy controllers.

## Who Built Wormhole?
Wormhole was created by [Gravitational Inc.](https://gravitational.com) We have built wormhole by leveraging our experience automating and supporting hundreds of kubernetes clusters with [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity/), our Kubernetes distribution optimized for deploying and remotely controlling complex applications into multiple environments at the same time:

- Multiple cloud regions
- Colocation
- Private enterprise clouds located behind firewalls
