# Gravitational Wormhole
Wormhole is a simple [CNI plugin](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni) designed to create an encrypted overlay network for [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) clusters.

[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) is a fascinating Fast, Modern, Secure VPN tunnel, that has been gaining significant praise from security experts, and is currently proposed for inclusion within the linux kernel.

Wormhole uses WireGuard to create a simple and secure high performance encrypted overlay network for kubernetes clusters, that is easy to manage and troubleshoot.

Wormhole does not implement network policy, instead we recommend to use [calico](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico) or [kube-router](https://github.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router) as network policy controllers.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements
1. [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) is installed on each node in you're cluster.
2. A Kubernetes cluster with IPAM enabled (--pod-network-cidr= when using kubeadm based install)

### Install
```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gravitational/wormhole/master/docs/kube-wormhole.yaml
```


## Build and Publish to a docker registry

```
WORM_REGISTRY_IMAGE="quay.io/gravitational/wormhole" go run mage.go build:publish
```

## Test

## Who Built Wormhole?
Wormhole was created by [Gravitational Inc.](https://gravitational.com) We have built wormhole by leveraging our experience automating and supporting hundreds of kubernetes clusters with [Gravity](https://gravitational.com/gravity/), our Kubernetes distribution optimized for deploying and remotely controlling complex applications into multiple environments at the same time:

- Multiple cloud regions
- Colocation
- Private enterprise clouds located behind firewalls
